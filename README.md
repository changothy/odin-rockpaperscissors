# odin-rockpaperscissors
The Rock-Paper-Scissors project for The Odin Project.

## Summary
A simple rock-paper-scissors game based in JavaScript. A prompt appears asking for user input (rock, paper, or scissors), which is pitted against a randomly generated opponent choice. Scores are tallied in a best of 5.

## Thoughts
- The game would function much better with a UI instead of constant manual user input.
- Results and error messages are also fed through to console.log, which doesn't make for a great experience.
