# odin-rockpaperscissors
The Rock-Paper-Scissors project for The Odin Project.

## Summary
A simple rock-paper-scissors game based in JavaScript. The user chooses rock, paper, or scissors, which is pitted against a randomly generated opponent choice. The results are displayed and a running score tally is updated. By default, the winner is the first to reach 5.

## Thoughts
- The game would function much better with a UI instead of constant manual user input.
- Results and error messages are also fed through to console.log, which doesn't make for a great experience.

## Thoughts after UI project
- It's pretty barebones but the underlying functionality is there. I see a lot of potential.
- Other ideas include adding a history log showing the results of the last 10 games.
